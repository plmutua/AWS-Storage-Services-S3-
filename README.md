# AWS-Storage-Services-S3-
The configuration for the programming environment
involved identifying an AWS SDK tool to work with as well
as updating the AWS credentials for the AWS account. This is
outlined in the steps below:
1. We identified two AWS SDK tools; Java and Python.
2. Configuration of the AWS credentials using aws
configure command in the AWS CLI.
aws configure

3. In Python, we used Boto3 which is AWS SDK tool
for python and sublime.
pip install boto3

4. In java we coded using the AWS SDK toolkit in
Eclipse without using Maven following the AWS
SDK for Java Developer guide.
